    "## Overview\n",
    "The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility has a significant data record of surface flux (momentum, sensible and latent heat, and CO2) data available at multiple locations around the Southern Great Plains (SGP) observatory.  This project will explore long-term data analysis of the fluxes and break down the flux statistics by vegetation type.  Students will gain experience with Python, surface flux data, ARM, and open-source software. Topics included in this notebook are:\n",

    "The eddy correlation (ECOR) flux measurement system provides half-hour measurements of the surface turbulent fluxes of momentum, sensible heat, latent heat, and carbon dioxide. The ECOR uses the eddy covariance technique, which involves correlation of the vertical wind component with the horizontal wind component, air temperature, water vapor density, and CO2 density.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on the system can be found on [ARM's ECOR instrument page](https://arm.gov/capabilities/instruments/ecor).  Please note that the [Instrument Handbook](https://www.arm.gov/publications/tech_reports/handbooks/ecor_handbook.pdf) has a lot of useful information in it as well, including some good quality control information that will come in handy later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are fluxes important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Land-atmosphere interactions (LAI) are the main drivers of earth's surface water and energy budgets.  Understanding how energy, heat, and greenhouse gases flow from the surface is important for verifying and improving global climate models.  Understanding the impact crop type has on these fluxes can have wide impacts as 52% of the U.S. land base is used for agriculture ([USDA](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/land-use-land-value-tenure/#:~:text=Agricultural%20production%20is%20a%20major,of%20the%20U.S.%20land%20base.)) with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations indicating that roughly 38% of the entire world is dedicated to agriculture."

    "\n",
    "If you read the instrument webpage, it noted that the 30ecor datastream has the uncorrected fluxes and it's recommended that routine ECOR corrections are applied.  The corrected data are available in the 30qcecor Value-Added Product (VAP) so that is what we are going to be working with.  Note that this dataset is only available from 2010 onward and the SGP ECOR systems were upgraded in October 2019 and are producing corrected fluxes in the ECORSF datastream.  While the QCECOR product has corrected fluxes it doees not include wind direction and speed that we will need later on so we will need to download both the QCECOR and base ECOR data products."

Some more investigation might be warranted.  Site operations keeps logs of vegetation at each of the sites which could provide more detailed information.  \n",

    "This was just a quick example for processing a weeks worth of data from one facility at ARM's SGP site.  There is much more data to get processing on!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at how you can improve the function to get the crop type based on wind direction.  It might be best to get the crop types by wind direction for every degree or 2 for a single year and use that instead of querying the API for each sample.\n",
    "1. Process a year's worth of data and see what that looks like!\n",
    "1. Develop some statistics that you can track for each crop type (min, max, median, mean are a good start) by year\n",
    "1. Look at other variables like latent_heat_flux.  We can also look at the uncorrected CO2 Flux from the ECOR datastream or look at the new ECORSF data to see how it compares.\n",
    "1. Now that this process is set, are there other systems or variables that would be interesting to look at?\n",
    "1. Have fun!  This project is for you to get familiar with ARM, Fluxes, and explore data!"
